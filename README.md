# Presentation

Small project realized during a python course, the goal was to build a recursive quadtree from a file containing a list.

# Instructions

See : https://gitlab.com/docusland-courses/python/python-exercices-ludiques/-/blob/arbre-quaternaire/README.md?ref_type=heads

# Setup

1.Install python3 on your computer, see : https://www.python.org/downloads/

2.Create a virtual environnement in your machine (best practice) with the following command on your directory :  `python -m venv venv`

3.Start your VEnv  with the following command on your directory : windows -> `venv\Scripts\activate` / Others -> `source venv/bin/activate`

4.Install libraries on your VEnv with the following command on your directory : `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5.If you want to quit VEnv write the following command on your directory : `deactivate`

# Run 

You can run the tests with the command : `python -m pytest tests/test_quadtree.py -x`

Or you can run main to see the visual version of the quadtree
